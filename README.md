# TitanicDataset  
Based on the sinking of the RMS Titanic, that ended up killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. One of the reasons for such loss was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Some groups of people were more likely to survive than others by analysing data and applying machine learning and predict which passenger survived the tragedy  
  ### Data Insigts  
Here are some insights we had analysing the Data.
1. Pclass,Sex,Fare Categorical features.
2.Comparing Genders, Females are way more likely to survive.
3.The fares didn't contribute much to the model
4.Names are unique in the dataset, so they are useless without preprocessing  
  ### Model Implemented
  Logistic Regression
